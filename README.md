# Telescope

Add analytics to your product with context built for AI agents.

Telescope scans your codebase, generates a `tracking-plan.md` with full context — what each metric means, why it matters, what's normal, what's broken — and commits PostHog tracking code. The result: AI agents can answer "why did activation drop this week?" instead of staring at raw numbers.

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and any AI coding tool.

## Install — 30 seconds

Open your AI coding tool and paste this:

**Claude Code:**

> Install telescope: run `git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/foggylabs/telescope.git ~/.claude/skills/telescope && cd ~/.claude/skills/telescope && ./setup` then add a "Telescope" section to CLAUDE.md that lists the available skills: `/telescope-explore` — scan and understand your codebase, `/telescope-plan` — generate a tracking plan, `/telescope-review` — validate the plan, `/telescope-execute` — generate tracking code, `/telescope-add-feature-plan` — add tracking for a new feature. Start with `/telescope-explore` for initial setup or `/telescope-add-feature-plan` for existing projects.

**Cursor / Codex / Other:**

> Install telescope: run `git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/foggylabs/telescope.git ~/.telescope && cd ~/.telescope && ./setup` then add a "Telescope" section to your instructions listing: `/telescope-explore`, `/telescope-plan`, `/telescope-review`, `/telescope-execute`, `/telescope-add-feature-plan`. Start with `/telescope-explore`.

## Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/telescope-explore` | Scan and understand your codebase — stack, routes, auth, payments, existing analytics. Builds a complete mental model before generating anything. |
| `/telescope-plan` | Generate `tracking-plan.md` — the semantic layer. Funnel metrics, marketing attribution, event properties — all structured for AI agent consumption. |
| `/telescope-review` | Data analyst review — validates the plan against actual code paths, checks AI agent readiness, flags issues by severity. |
| `/telescope-execute` | Generate tracking code — PostHog setup, event capture, first-touch attribution, revenue tracking, user identification. Commits to repo. |
| `/telescope-add-feature-plan` | Add tracking for a new feature to an existing plan. Point it at your code, it proposes events, updates the semantic layer, and generates tracking code. |

## The flow

**Initial setup:**
```
/telescope-explore → /telescope-plan → /telescope-review → /telescope-execute
    understand          generate           validate            implement
```

**New feature:**
```
/telescope-add-feature-plan
```

Each skill auto-triggers the next. The only user gate is after `/telescope-review` — you read the tracking plan and confirm before code is generated.

## What it generates

**`tracking-plan.md`** — analytics context that AI agents can read:
- Funnel metrics with normal ranges and red flags
- Marketing attribution (channels, revenue per visitor)
- Event properties (schema for each event)

**Tracking code** — placed in the correct files, client-side for UI interactions, server-side for state changes.

## Supported stacks

Next.js, React + Vite, Express, Django, Flask, Rails, Go. Payment providers: Stripe, LemonSqueezy, Paddle, Polar.
