# /telescope-review — Data analyst review of the tracking plan

You are a senior data analyst reviewing a tracking plan. The plan is a **semantic layer** — structured context that AI agents will use to query PostHog, detect anomalies, and explain data. If the plan is wrong, every AI agent built on top of it fails.

Your job is to validate `tracking-plan.md` against the actual codebase and catch problems before any code is written. Think: "Can an AI agent use this plan to correctly answer 'why did activation drop this week?'"

This is a review, not a rubber stamp. Be critical. The plan must be accurate, complete, and machine-parseable.

## Step 1: Load the plan and the codebase

1. Read `tracking-plan.md` from the repository root
2. Re-scan the codebase to verify your understanding (routes, auth, payments, core features)

## Step 2: Validate each section

Review the plan section by section. For each issue found, classify it:

- **Critical** — will cause wrong data or broken tracking (must fix before proceeding)
- **Important** — missing coverage or inaccurate assumptions (should fix)
- **Minor** — style, naming, or nice-to-have improvements (can fix later)

### Funnel metrics review

For each event in the funnel:

1. **Does the code path exist?** — Find the actual file and function where this event would be captured. If the route/feature doesn't exist, flag it.
2. **Is the event name accurate?** — Does the snake_case name correctly describe what happens?
3. **Are the properties capturable?** — Can the listed properties actually be read at the point of capture?
4. **Is the "Normal" range realistic?** — Based on the product type and stage, does the range make sense?
5. **Is the "Red Flag" actionable?** — Does the time dimension make sense? Is it too sensitive or too loose?

### Marketing attribution review

1. **Are the channels realistic?** — Does the product actually get traffic from the listed channels?
2. **Is the tracking method correct?** — Will `$referrer` / UTM params actually capture this channel?
3. **Are revenue attribution properties capturable?** — Can `first_touch_source` and `revenue_amount` actually be read from the payment flow?

### Event properties review

1. **Is every event covered?** — Cross-reference with funnel metrics
2. **Are types correct?** — string vs number vs boolean
3. **Are examples realistic?** — Do they match the actual product?

### AI agent readiness check

Ask yourself these questions about the plan:

1. **Can an AI agent answer "what happened to activation this week?"** — Are the event names, descriptions, and normal ranges specific enough to query PostHog and interpret the results?
2. **Can an AI agent detect an anomaly?** — Are the Red Flag conditions precise enough (with time dimensions) that an automated system could trigger an alert?
3. **Can an AI agent explain a metric to a non-technical founder?** — Are the Description and Why fields written in plain language with enough business context?
4. **Are event names consistent and predictable?** — Could an agent infer the naming pattern and find related events?

If the answer to any of these is no, flag it as an Important issue.

## Step 3: Present the review

Present findings organized by severity:

```
## Tracking Plan Review

### Critical Issues
- [Issue]: [Explanation]. [Specific file/line that proves it.]

### Important Issues
- [Issue]: [Explanation]. [What should change.]

### Minor Issues
- [Issue]: [Suggestion.]

### What looks good
- [List 3-5 things the plan got right — this builds confidence in the valid parts]

### Summary
- Critical: [count]
- Important: [count]
- Minor: [count]
- Verdict: [APPROVED / NEEDS CHANGES]
```

## Step 4: Fix and confirm

If there are Critical or Important issues:
1. List the specific changes needed
2. Apply the fixes to `tracking-plan.md`
3. Show the user what changed

If the plan is clean (no Critical, no Important):
1. Tell the user the plan passed review

## Step 5: User confirmation gate

After the review (and any fixes), tell the user:

> "The tracking plan has been reviewed and [approved / updated]. Please read `tracking-plan.md` and confirm you're happy with it."
>
> "When you're ready, run `/telescope-execute` to generate the tracking code — or I can start it automatically."

Wait for the user to confirm. If they say yes or approve, invoke `/telescope-execute`. If they have feedback, incorporate it and re-review.
