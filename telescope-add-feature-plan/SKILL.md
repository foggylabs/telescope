description: Add PostHog tracking for a new feature to an existing tracking-plan.md. Reads the feature code, proposes events that follow existing conventions, updates the plan, and generates tracking code. For projects that already have telescope set up and a new feature needs coverage. Use when the user wants to extend tracking for a freshly-built feature.

# /telescope-add-feature-plan — Add tracking for a new feature to an existing plan

You are a product analytics expert. The user already has a `tracking-plan.md` (a semantic layer that AI agents use to understand the product's data) and PostHog tracking in their project. They've built a new feature and need to extend the semantic layer to cover it.

Your job: understand the new feature, generate tracking events for it, add them to the existing `tracking-plan.md`, and generate the tracking code. The new events must be consistent with the existing plan so AI agents can reason across old and new features seamlessly. Do NOT touch existing events or tracking code — only add new ones.

## Step 1: Verify prerequisites

1. Check that `tracking-plan.md` exists in the repo root. If it doesn't, tell the user to run `/telescope-explore` first.
2. Read the existing `tracking-plan.md` to understand what's already tracked — event names, funnel stages, properties, conventions.
3. Check that PostHog SDK is already installed. If not, tell the user to run `/telescope-execute` first.

## Step 2: Understand the feature

Ask the user:

> "Which feature do you want to track? Point me at the code — a directory, files, PR, or describe what it does."

Then explore the feature code thoroughly:
- Read every file the user pointed to
- Understand what the feature does, what user actions are possible
- Map the user journey through this feature (entry point → actions → outcomes)
- Identify what's worth tracking vs what's noise

Do NOT assume — read the actual code. If the feature spans multiple files, read all of them.

## Step 3: Propose events

Based on the feature code, propose new events. Present them to the user before writing anything:

```
## Proposed events for [feature name]

| Event | Capture | Description | Where | Properties |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------|------------|
| feature_name_started | client | User opens/starts the feature | file:line | prop1, prop2 |
| feature_name_completed | server | User completes the key action | file:line | prop1, prop2 |
| feature_name_error | server | Something went wrong | file:line | error_type |
```

Rules:
- Only propose events PostHog autocapture can't handle. Page views, button clicks, form submissions are already captured — use PostHog Actions to group those, not custom events.
- Follow the existing naming conventions from `tracking-plan.md` (snake_case, naming patterns)
- Mark `client` for UI interactions, `server` for state changes (capture where authoritative)
- Include the specific file and approximate location where each event would be captured
- Keep it focused — track business logic and state changes, not every UI interaction
- Propose 2-6 events per feature (not more unless the feature is complex)
- Include relevant properties for each event (no `string[]` — use comma-separated strings)
- Server-side events must note where `distinct_id` comes from
- If the feature has notable UI interactions (specific CTAs, navigation), propose PostHog Actions instead of custom events

Ask the user: "Does this look right? Want to add, remove, or change anything?"

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

## Step 4: Update tracking-plan.md

Add the new events to the existing `tracking-plan.md`:

1. **Funnel metrics** — add new rows to the appropriate funnel stage (Acquisition, Activation, Engagement, Retention, Revenue). Most feature events go under Engagement.
2. **Event properties** — add a new subsection per event with the property schema.
3. **Marketing attribution** — only update if the feature involves a new acquisition channel or conversion point.

Rules:
- Add to existing tables, do NOT rewrite or reorder existing entries
- Match the existing formatting exactly (column widths, style)
- New events go at the end of the relevant stage table
- Include `Capture` column (client/server) for new metrics

## Step 5: Generate tracking code

For each new event, generate `posthog.capture()` calls and place them in the correct files:

```ts
posthog.capture('feature_name_completed', {
  property_1: value1,
  property_2: value2,
})
```

Rules:
- Place events in the exact files/functions identified in Step 3
- Match the existing code style (imports, patterns used elsewhere in the project)
- Server-side events: use `posthog-python` or `posthog-node` matching existing patterns. Always pass `distinct_id` from the authenticated session.
- Client-side events: use `posthog.capture()`. Don't duplicate what autocapture already handles.
- If the feature needs group context, include `groups` parameter on server-side captures.
- Do NOT modify existing tracking code — only add new calls

## Step 6: Summary and commit

Show the user:

> **Added tracking for [feature name]:**
> - **X new events** added to tracking-plan.md
> - **Y files** modified with tracking code
>
> New events: `event_1`, `event_2`, `event_3`
>
> Want me to commit?

Wait for confirmation. Commit with message:

```
feat: add tracking for [feature name] (via /telescope-add-feature-plan)
```
