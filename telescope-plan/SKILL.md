# /telescope-plan — Generate a personalized tracking plan

You are a product analytics expert. Your job is to generate a `tracking-plan.md` — a **semantic layer** that AI agents will use to understand this product's analytics data.

This is not documentation for humans to read occasionally. It is structured context that AI agents (data analysts, SRE bots, MCP servers) will parse to:
- Query PostHog with business context ("what happened to activation this week?")
- Detect anomalies ("signup rate is below the red flag threshold")
- Explain data ("this metric dropped because...")

Every field matters. Vague descriptions, generic ranges, or missing properties mean the AI agent fails. Be specific, be structured, be machine-parseable.

You should have a complete understanding of the codebase from `/telescope-explore`. If you don't, run `/telescope-explore` first.

**Do NOT generate any tracking code.** Only the plan.

## Step 1: Business discovery

Ask the user these 5 questions. Use AskUserQuestion with all 5 in a single call:

1. **Product basics**: "What's your product name and what does it do in one sentence?"
2. **Activation**: "What does a successful user do in their first session? What's the 'aha moment'?"
3. **Revenue**: "How do you make money (or plan to)? Which payment provider?"
4. **Marketing channels**: "Where do your users come from? (e.g., Twitter/X, Reddit, Product Hunt, SEO, paid ads, newsletter)"
5. **Biggest unknown**: "What's the #1 thing you wish you knew about how people use your product?"

Combine the answers with the codebase exploration to generate the plan.

## Step 2: Generate tracking-plan.md

Create `tracking-plan.md` in the repository root.

### Format

The file has YAML frontmatter followed by markdown sections:

```yaml
---
version: "0.1"
generated: "<ISO 8601 timestamp>"
generator: "telescope/0.1.0"
product:
  name: "<from user answer>"
  type: "saas"           # saas | marketplace | api | mobile | ecommerce | other
  business_model: "subscription"  # subscription | freemium | transactional | ad_supported | free
  stage: "pre_revenue"   # pre_revenue | has_users | has_revenue
analytics:
  provider: "posthog"
  project_id: ""
stack:
  framework: "<detected>"
  language: "<detected>"
  deployment: "<detected>"
---
```

### Section 1: Funnel Metrics (required)

Five funnel stages, each with a table:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Metric | Human-readable name (e.g., "Signup completed") |
| Event | PostHog event name in snake_case (e.g., `user_signed_up`) |
| Description | One sentence explaining what this measures |
| Why | Why this matters for the business |
| Normal | Expected range, specific to this product (e.g., "3-8% of visitors") |
| Red Flag | Problem condition with time dimension (e.g., "<2% for 3+ days") |

Stages: **Acquisition**, **Activation**, **Engagement**, **Retention**, **Revenue** (omit Revenue if `stage: pre_revenue`).

Rules:
- Every stage has at least 1 metric
- Event names in snake_case (PostHog convention)
- "Normal" ranges must be specific, never "varies" or "depends"
- "Red Flag" conditions must include a time dimension
- Events must map to actual code paths found during exploration

### Section 2: Marketing Attribution (recommended)

**Channel table:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Channel | Marketing channel name (e.g., "Organic Search", "Twitter/X") |
| Tracking Method | How identified (e.g., "UTM params", "`$referrer` header") |
| Key Metrics | What to measure (e.g., "visitors, signups, revenue/visitor") |
| Attribution Event | PostHog event that captures the source |

Include channels the user mentioned + standard ones (Organic Search, Paid Ads, Social Media, Direct, Referral, Email).

**Revenue Attribution Properties** (on conversion/payment events):

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| first_touch_source | string | Original traffic source (first visit) |
| first_touch_medium | string | Original medium |
| first_touch_campaign | string | Original campaign (if UTM) |
| last_touch_source | string | Most recent source before conversion |
| revenue_amount | number | Transaction amount in cents |
| payment_provider | string | Payment processor used |

### Section 3: Event Properties (recommended)

Schema for each event. Under `## Event Properties`, add a subsection per event with a table:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Property | Property name |
| Type | string, number, boolean |
| Description | What it captures |
| Example | Example value |

Include marketing-related properties on relevant events (UTM params, referrer, first-touch attribution).

## Quality check

Before saving, verify:
1. Every metric has all columns filled with specific, non-generic content
2. Event names are valid snake_case
3. "Normal" ranges are specific to this product type
4. "Red Flag" conditions include a time dimension
5. Events map to real code paths found during exploration (not invented features)
6. Marketing attribution covers the channels the user mentioned

## After generating

Save `tracking-plan.md` to the repository root. Tell the user:

> "Tracking plan generated. Running `/telescope-review` to validate it against your codebase."

Then invoke `/telescope-review`.
